                        <p>That was the year I was born, in São Paulo, Brazil, at around 9:30 pm. That was the year I began my journey of learning.</p>

                        <p>After learning a lot with my family and friends, this year I left my parent's house. Actually, I left my country for a while and moved to Winnipeg in Canada to study. One of the most incredible experiences of my life.</p>

                        <h1>2017</h1>
                        <p>Here I left my city once again, and moved to Toledo, in the state of Paraná (Br), to start my graduation course on Bioprocess and Biotechnology Engineer, I chose this course because I have always been very curious about life, about science and technology, about how things work.</p>

                        <h1>2020</h1>
                        <p>At the beginning of the year, I participate in an innovate competition organized by a big company called Uniprime, in which the squads had to develop a solution for a problem faced by the company. After 2 weeks, there would have a pitch to 'sell' the idea, and my squad was the winner of the competition. That was really important for me because it showed me that working in group is fundamental, and also that I can work on things out of my comfort zone since the whole project was not related in any way to my graduation course.</p>

                          <h1>2021</h1>
                          <p>That was the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. It had been one year that we were not leaving our houses, and doing everything remotely. It was not easy, I was living alone, far from my family and not being able to see even my closest friends. However, I must say I learned a lot during this period, I studied about self-knowledge, about how to manage my time better, I started to study French (my third language), among other topics I had always wanted to learn and practice, but 'had never had time'.</p>

                          <h1>2022</h1>
                          <p>Here was the point in time that I met the programming field. I took an intensive 6-month course on Full Stack Development at a very respected University in Toledo called Biopark. The course showed me the incredible world of development and IT, and also was an amazing opportunity for me to improve my Soft Skills and to see clearly what I wish for my future.</p>

                          <h1>2023</h1>
                          <p>This is the year that I expect to finish my graduation course, hoping a lot to publish some articles during this process. Also, I will be taking another intensive programming course called Desenvolve, by the Boticário Group and the Alura online school, so I expect that to be of great improvement of my knowledge on programming.</p>
